# Legatus

## Intro 

The basic idea of *Legatus* is that we want some network abstraction layer that
sufficiently encapsulates actually calling Alamofire directly.

Also, it would be cool to have network layer, that will support ***SwiftUI***, isn't it?üßê
Luckily, *Legatus* was implemented with `Combine` framework and have couple of fancy methods, that will allow you to `assign(to:on:)` your response models right to `@Published` properties. Neat!ü§©

### Some awesome features of Legatus:

- SOLID design (`APIClient` don't stores and configures requests, each request is encapsulated in separate entity).
- Elegant and easy retrying of requests.
- SwiftUI support.
- Support JSON and XML reponse formats.

*Legatus* is inspired by [Moya](https://github.com/Moya/Moya).
