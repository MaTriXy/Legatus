# Legatus 🏇

## Intro 🧑‍💻

The basic idea of *Legatus* is that we want some network abstraction layer that
sufficiently encapsulates actually calling Alamofire directly.

Also, it would be cool to have network layer, that will compatible with ***SwiftUI*** out-of-the-box 📦, isn't it?🧐

Luckily, *Legatus* was implemented with `Combine` framework and have couple of fancy methods, that will allow you to `assign(to:on:)` your response models right to `@Published` properties. Neat!🤩

### Some awesome features of Legatus🌟:

- SOLID design (e.g.: `APIClient` don't stores and configures requests, each request is encapsulated in separate entity).
- Easy retrying of requests.
- Elegant and flexible canceling of requests.
- ***SwiftUI*** compatiblity out-of-the-box.
- Support JSON and XML reponse formats.

*Legatus* is inspired by [Moya](https://github.com/Moya/Moya).

## Installation 📦 

- #### Swift Package Manager

You can use Xcode 11 SPM GUI: *File -> Swift Packages -> Add Package Dependency*.

Or add the following to your `Package.swift` file:

```swift
.package(url: "https://github.com/artemkalinovsky/Legatus.git", .upToNextMajor(from: "1.0.0"))
```

and then specify `"Legatus"` as a dependency of the Target in which you wish to use Legatus.
Here's an example `PackageDescription`:

```swift
// swift-tools-version:5.1
import PackageDescription

let package = Package(
    name: "MyPackage",
    products: [
        .library(
            name: "MyPackage",
            targets: ["MyPackage"]),
    ],
    dependencies: [
        .package(url: "https://github.com/artemkalinovsky/Legatus.git", .upToNextMajor(from: "1.0.0"))
    ],
    targets: [
        .target(
            name: "MyPackage",
            dependencies: ["Legatus"])
    ]
)
```
